Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (“PMS”) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  \n",

        "description": "High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.",

Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs.",

Driving at or below 25 MPH decreases stopping distance, gives drivers and pedestrians more time to see each other and react, and improves drivers’ ability to avoid crashes. Pedestrians struck by vehicles traveling at 25 MPH are half as likely to die as those struck at 30 MPH. If crashes do occur, the severity of injuries is reduced a lower speeds. The information shown here was compiled by the New York City Department of Transportation for governmental purposes. The information is updated as soon as reasonably practicable. The public is advised that speed limits are subject to temporary or permanent change and that posted signage must be observed for compliance with laws and regulations.",

Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis.

        "description": "Maternal mortality is widely considered an indicator of overall population health and the status of women in the population. DOHMH uses multiple methods including death certificates, vital records linkage, medical examiner records, and hospital discharge data to identify all pregnancy-associated deaths (deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year of the end of pregnancy) of New York state residents in NYC each year. DOHMH convenes the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee (M3RC), a multidisciplinary and diverse group of  40 members that conducts an in-depth, expert review of each pregnancy-associated death of New York state residents occurring in NYC from both clinical and social determinants of health perspectives. The data in this table come from vital records and the M3RC review process. Data are not cross-classified on all variables:  cause of death data are available by the relation to pregnancy (pregnancy-related, pregnancy-associated but not related, unable to determine), race/ethnicity and borough of residence data are each separately available for the total number of pregnancy-associated deaths and pregnancy-related deaths only.",

There were approximately 87,000 New York City district school students who resided in temporary housing in the 2020-21 school year, with about two thirds of them residing in doubled up living arrangements. Approximately 9,500 of those 87,000 students were residing in the DHS shelter system on any given night. The DOE works in close partnership with the Department of Homeless Services to provide streamlined support for students in shelter throughout each day.",

DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) also developed NFH Indexes to present patterns in the data within and across neighborhoods. NFH Index scores describe relative differences between neighborhoods across the same indicators; they do not evaluate neighborhoods against fixed standards. OFE intends for the NFH Indexes to provide an easy reference tool for comparing neighborhoods, and to establish patterns in the relationship of NFH indicators to economic and demographic factors, such as race and income. Understanding these connections is potentially useful for uncovering systems that perpetuate the racial wealth gap, an issue with direct implications for OFE’s mission to expand asset building opportunities for New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes. This data tool was borne out of the Collaborative for Neighborhood Financial Health, a community-led initiative designed to better understand how neighborhoods influence the financial health of their residents.",

Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system.",

SMM data are derived from linking NYC birth certificates for births occurring at NYC facilities with the mother's delivery hospitalization record from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. SMM is identified using an established algorithm developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that comprises 21 indicators that represent diagnoses of serious complications of pregnancy or delivery or procedures used to manage serious conditions. Each record represents the aggregated number and rate of SMM events in the population group specified for the year specified.",

Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type.

Modified ZCTA reflects the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result. This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation. It can be challenging to map data that are reported by ZIP Code. A ZIP Code doesn’t refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes. To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data can also be accessed here: ",

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires local municipalities that receive CDBG formula entitlement funds to use the 2011-2015 ACS LMISD data file to determine where CDBG funds may be used for activities that are available to all the residents in a particular area. A CD-eligible census tract refers to 2010 census tracts where the area is primarily residential and at least 51.0% of the residents are low- and moderate-income as per the LMISD data file. For New York City, a primarily residential area is defined as one where at least 50.0% of the total built floor area is residential as determined by PLUTO 18v2.1. Low- and moderate-income persons are defined as persons living in households with incomes below 80 percent of the area median household income (AMI). The New York Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area's AMI was $70,300 for a 4-person family at the release of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey.",

The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. \n",

The Health Department often receives more than one report for each person with chronic hepatitis C and uses automatic de-duplication methods to identify repeat reports based on name, date of birth, and other information. Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis C test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis C RNA. For chronic hepatitis C, in 2016, the CDC/CSTE case definition for confirmed or probable cases was changed. CDC’s 2016 case definition is used for people first reported with chronic hepatitis C in 2016 and onward. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis C reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis C and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis C are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported. Therefore, surveillance data underestimate the true level of chronic hepatitis C in NYC.",

The cohort consists of al students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a local or regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma for GED.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed.  Due to small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab, however these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.",

The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement.

Waste from these generators was categorized into 96 main material categories, which are provided in this dataset by residential strata and time period. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type, per stream.

The cohort consists of al students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in 2006-2007 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a local or regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma for GED. In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed. Due to small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab, however these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.",

It uses a statistical model to summarize the most important social and environmental factors that contribute to neighborhood heat risk. The factors included in the HVI are surface temperature, green space, access to home air conditioning, and the percentage of residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black. Differences in these risk factors across neighborhoods are rooted in past and present racism.  Neighborhoods are scored from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk) by summing the following factors and assigning them into 5 groups (quintiles):                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The 2023 Study determined the waste composition of several major sources from which DSNY collects: residential households, New York City Public Schools, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and on-street litter baskets. Waste from these generators was categorized into 96 main material categories. In addition to the 96 sort categories, certain material groups were further subsorted into 826 subsort categories which are provided in this dataset by residential strata and time period. Because not all the main material categories were subsorted, there are two separate datasets — one for the main sort results and one for the subsort results. Results for both datasets are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type, per stream. The quantity of each material is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of specified DSNY collections.",

Unless otherwise signed, all streets in New York City are governed by this 25 mph speed limit. Driving at or below 25 MPH decreases stopping distance, gives drivers and pedestrians more time to see each other and react, and improves drivers’ ability to avoid crashes. Pedestrians struck by vehicles traveling at 25 MPH are half as likely to die as those struck at 30 MPH. If crashes do occur, the severity of injuries is reduced a lower speeds. The information shown here was compiled by the New York City Department of Transportation for governmental purposes. The information is updated as soon as reasonably practicable. The public is advised that speed limits are subject to temporary or permanent change and that posted signage must be observed for compliance with laws and regulations.",
